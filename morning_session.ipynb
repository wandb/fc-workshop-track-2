    "\n",
    "Despite excellent engineering (comprehensive context, structured output, expert prompting), \n",
    "the naive LLM approach demonstrates several fundamental limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. 🎯 Single Decision Point Limitation**\n",
    "- No adaptation or learning from intermediate results\n",
    "- Cannot adjust strategy based on action outcomes\n",
    "- One-shot approach vs iterative refinement\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. 🧠 Memory and State Management Issues**\n",
    "- Cannot remember previous actions or their outcomes during execution\n",
    "- No learning from failures or successes within the same session\n",
    "- No persistent context across multiple coordination cycles\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. 🔄 Coordination and Feedback Gaps**\n",
    "- Services cannot provide feedback for real-time strategy adjustment\n",
    "- No mechanism for cross-service communication and status updates\n",
    "- Cannot handle cascading effects or interdependencies dynamically\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. ⏱️ Real-Time Monitoring Limitations**\n",
    "- Cannot continuously monitor and adjust to changing conditions\n",
    "- No mechanism for handling events that occur during execution\n",
    "- Fixed strategy cannot adapt to evolving crisis conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. 📏 Context Window and Scalability Constraints**\n",
    "- Limited ability to process unlimited real-time data streams\n",
    "- Context window limitations affect complex, multi-step reasoning\n",
    "- Scalability issues with large numbers of services and resources\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. 🎭 Generic vs Specialized Reasoning**\n",
    "- General intelligence vs domain-specific expertise\n",
    "- Lacks deep understanding of service-specific constraints and patterns\n",
    "- Cannot leverage specialized knowledge that comes from focused training\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. 🔁 Iterative Refinement Challenges**\n",
    "- No mechanism for continuous improvement during execution\n",
